#### Description:
    BlackJack Nova is an interactive Python-based card game inspired by the classic casino game, Blackjack. The game is designed to be played in a console or terminal environment, offering a user-friendly text-based interface that brings the excitement of Blackjack to your computer.
    Upon starting the game, players are greeted with an ASCII art title "Welcome to BlackJack Nova" rendered using the PyFiglet library, which instantly sets an engaging tone. The game begins with a balance of $0, prompting the player to deposit money to start playing. This initial interaction not only simulates a real casino experience but also introduces a basic financial management aspect to the game.
    The core gameplay loop is simple yet engaging. Players choose from a menu to play the game, deposit more money, check their balance, or quit. When playing, they place a bet and are dealt two cards, with the aim of getting the total card value as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game uses a standard deck of 52 cards, represented in text form, including all ranks from Two to Ace and suits - Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. The card generation and valuation are managed by dedicated functions, ensuring a random and fair game experience.
    A key feature of BlackJack Nova is its adherence to the traditional Blackjack rules. Players can choose to 'hit' (take another card) or 'stand' (keep their current hand), with the game automatically making a 'hit' if the player's total is under 16. The dealer, played by the computer, follows the rule of hitting until their card total is 17 or more. This adherence to standard rules makes the game familiar to Blackjack enthusiasts and easy to understand for new players.
    Another notable aspect of BlackJack Nova is its management of game states and player balance. The game keeps track of the player's wins, losses, and draws, as well as their financial balance. This feature not only adds a layer of strategy to the game but also teaches players the importance of managing their bets responsibly. The balance is adjusted according to the player's bets and game outcomes, providing a realistic gambling experience.
    The game's user interface is primarily text-based, offering clear and concise instructions and feedback. The use of ASCII art for card representation and game headings adds a charming retro feel. The game outputs are designed for clarity, displaying the player's hand, the dealer's hand (when revealed), and the current balance after each round.
    The game's code structure is modular, with functions dedicated to different aspects of the game, such as depositMoney, deductMoney, cardGenerator, cardValue, and handValue. This modular design makes the code easy to understand and maintain. Additionally, the use of Python's match statement (similar to switch-case in other languages) for menu navigation and game choices demonstrates modern Python programming practices.
